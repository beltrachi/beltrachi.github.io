# Beltrachi's blog

Based on jekyll + Minimal Mistakes.

##  How to add a post

1. Create a new file in _posts copying the header from the last post.
2. Change the header attributes.
3. Write the post.
4. Commit it and push it.

Then Github Pages will be regenerated and you can see the result in [https://beltrachi.github.io](https://beltrachi.github.io)

### How to add images?

In VSCode when editing a post, you can just paste it (Ctrl+v/Cmd+v) and it will be saved in the same folder as the post. **But that will not work**.

You need to move the pasted image into `/assets/images/` and reference it from the post.
